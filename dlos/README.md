# Line-of-Sight Dispalcement (dLOS)
A crucial element of the fiber collision correction method involves modeling and statistically reconstructing the line-of-sight
displacement between fiber collided galaxies. 

For each of the simulated and observed galaxy catalogs, we compute the comoving line-of-sight displacement (d_LOS) between the 
fiber collided galaxy pairs. These values are then used to construct the d_LOS distribution. We model this distribution by 
fitting a Gaussian function to the distribution. The best-fit parameters are then used in the fiber collision correction methods.
