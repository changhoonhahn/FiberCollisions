# Fourier Transformed Fiber collision Correction of Two-Point Corrleation Function

We quantify the FC correction for the 2-Point Correlation Function (2PCF) as a tophat function: 

$\frac{1 + \xi^{upw}}{1+\xi^{true}} = 1 + f_s W_{fc}(r_\perp)$.

where f_s is the fraction of the survey affected by fiber collisions, $\xi$ is the 2PCF as a function of $r_p$ and $pi$.   

We Fourier transform this correction in order to derive a correction for the power spectrum $P_l(k)$.
